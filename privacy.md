## 2. What Personal Data We Collect

RepQuest does not require account registration and does not collect personally identifiable information directly.

However, we use the following third-party services that collect limited, non-sensitive data to improve the functionality and security of our website:

### a) Alceris (Analytics)

We use **Alceris** for privacy-focused web analytics. Alceris only collects server-side data for technical and statistical purposes, including:

- IP address
- Pages visited
- Browser user agent
- Timestamp of visit

Alceris does **not** use cookies or track users across different sites.

### b) Sentry (Error Tracking)

We use **Sentry** to monitor and fix technical issues on the website. Sentry may collect technical error logs and diagnostic data, which may include:

- IP address
- Browser and device information
- Stack traces or code errors
- Time and URL of the request

This data is used solely for debugging and service maintenance.

#### Opting Out of Sentry Telemetry

You may opt out of Sentry telemetry by disabling the feature in the app:

**Go to:** `Settings > Telemetry`  
**Toggle:** _Telemetry_ to "off"

Please note: While optional, we recommend keeping telemetry enabled to help us detect and resolve issues faster and improve the reliability of RepQuest.
